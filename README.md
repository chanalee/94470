# About Me

Hello! My name is Chanaradee Leelamanthep, and I'm referred to by 'she/her/hers' pronouns. A little bit about myself, I am currently a junior studying Information Systems (concentration in Human Computer Interaction) with a double in Statistics and Machine Learning. To quickly summarize my area of interest, I enjoy analyzing data and presenting my findings to others so that they can turn meaningful findings into actionable insights. I want to use data and analytics to help people make better decisions! 

In my free time, I love to bake, watch dramas, and explore the city!

## What I Hope to Learn

I hope to become a better story teller when presenting data, whether that is through creating visualizations alone or communicating that visualization to others. There are many ways to present information, but some ways are more effective than others, whether that is because of the type of graph used, the color, choice of information displayed, the size, the brightness, the orientation, etc. By learning the theories behind information visualization and looking at various graphs, I know that I can learn and be inspired from those examples and become more creative as an analyst.
