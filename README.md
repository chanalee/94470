# About Me

Hello! My name is Chanaradee Leelamanthep, and I'm referred to by she/her/hers pronouns. A little bit about myself, I am currently a junior studying Information Systems (concentration in Human-Computer Interaction) with a double in Statistics and Machine Learning. To quickly summarize my area of interest, I enjoy analyzing data and presenting my findings to others so that they can turn meaningful findings into actionable insights. I want to use data and analytics to help people make better decisions! 

As for my background, I have not formally taken a data visualization class, but I have taken HCI and Statistics classes that required me to create different visualizations and graphs. In HCI classes, I explored different ways to present information, whether that is by choosing specific graphs to represent data, organizing a dashboard to summarize a finding, or adding interaction to visualizations on Figma. As for my statistics classes, most of the graphs that I interacted with are code-generated, specifically R and Python. 

In my free time, I love to bake, watch dramas, and explore the city!

## What I Hope to Learn

I hope to become a better storyteller when presenting data, whether that is through creating visualizations alone or communicating that visualization to others. There are many ways to present information, but some ways are more effective than others, whether that is because of the type of graph used, the color, choice of the information displayed, the size, the brightness, the orientation, etc. By learning the theories behind information visualization and looking at various graphs, I know that I can learn and be inspired from those examples and become more creative as an analyst. In addition to seeing examples, I hope to learn how to critique graphs so that I can explain why certain components work or do not work. This way, I can be more aware of my design choices and generate expressive graphs.
