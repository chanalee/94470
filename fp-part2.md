# Final Project Part 2

## High-fidelity visualizations and ideas

From the conversations with my peers and interviewees, I decided to limit the number of graphs and information that I tackle. For instance, in the first part of the project, I included a couple of graphs where I talked about how gender impacts certain phenomenons like how much sleep a person gets or how much more at risk a person is for a specific chronic disease. However, adding too much information takes away from the main story and distracts users from focusing on getting better sleep.

In this sectionm I will show 7 different concepts, in which each concept may be represented differently depending on what I came up with. I will comment on some of the graphs to show my thought process about why I chose to go with specific ones.

When I was first creating this graph, the information that I saw was 30% of the people obtain sufficient sleep. I knew that I wanted to use a dot matrix chart to emphasize the small number, but I was not sure how I wanted to display the data. You can see here that I showed all 100 dots as well as just 10 dots. I also rephrased how the information is presented to give more urgency to it. After careful consideration, I picked the 10 dots one as my final visualization because that does not overwhelm the user and the point is easily delivered. At the same time, talking about what is missing from something as supposed to what they already have is more engaging.

I wanted to explore different options in terms of this context because there is a lot of information to be presented but at the same time, showing them in a particular way might be better than others. For me, the graph at the bottom left is the most intuitive because I was used to seeing the revenue and net profit/loss graph. I soon realized that most people might not be used to it and might not be able to quickly receive the information. Hence, the top-left option is the most straightforward and noticeable one. The reason why I did not like the ones on the right as much is that the top one has too many lines that make it confusing and the bottom one has such a thin line that it is hard to notice.

Unlike the previous graphs, the differences are less significant in which it is just whether we use a human with no label or with an anatomy label. Initially, I wanted to go with the human with no label since that subtracts noise from the data. However, when people are reading this, I think they will get the sense of urgency more from seeing real organs and how those are impacted by sleep deprivation. Hence, I chose to include the right option in my wireframe.

I really like this visualization and think it is a really creative idea. However, one question I had while making this is the slices seem to make the hours of sleep discrete values. Is there a way to convey it such that it becomes more continuous?

After looking at the overarching theme and the flow of the information as a whole, I was able to choose which graph I wanted to display in the actual storyboard.

## User research and interviews

In order for me to leran more about my audience, conducting a user research is a great way for me to get their feedback. For this assignment, I interviewed 3 people. For the sake of anonymity, I will refer to them as A, B, and C. A, B, and C are currently college students at Carnegie Mellon University. They are 22, 21, and 21 years old respectively. 

For my research, I decided to ask the following questions:

- What are your first impressions?
- Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?
- What do you think the purpose of this is?
- Who do you think this is for?
- Does the content support its title?
- Does the storyline flow smoothly? 
- What is confusing about this?
- What would you change?
- Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? 
- Is there any additional information you would like to know

Here are the responses from my interviewees.

For the first question, A and B's answers are pretty similar. A commented that the storyline is "pretty cohesive in that the introduction is laid down, followed by the problems and solutions at the end", while B commented that the information is straightforward. However, A also mentioned that having different age groups in the second visualization "threw [them] off" as they were not expecting to see that information. It made them question "why do I have to see this" and "why is this relevant to me". In addition to just the storyline, B and C both critiqued some visualizations. C commented that the clock is very creative but also noted that 12 and 9 are in split colors. They wondered if there is something that can be done to prevent that from happening or if another visualization would convey the same point. B said that they liked the use of pictures since pictures are better at expressing information than words. They also mentioned how they strongly disliked the treemap because it is hard to interpret. 

For the second question, all responses are pretty unanimous but with varying detail. C said that the story emphasizes that people don't get enough sleep and encourages people to sleep more. "If you don't get enough sleep, there are bad consequences." This is what B said: "A lot of people don’t get enough sleep, especially those between 10-39. Not getting enough sleep is not great because you have a higher chance of getting different chronic diseases. It also affects memory, mental health, and makes your organs tired. It also negatively impacts your daily routine such as mood, focusing, eating, going out, etc. The sufficient amount of sleep we should get per night is 7-9. More than 9 is excessive, and less than 7 is deficient. You should do common things to relax."

For the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth question, the answers are quite similar so it seems that the purpose, the audience, and the overall text of the storyline is obvious. Interviewee A pointed out that the strongest point is "sleep deficit is a serious and real problem" and added the second point that "people can do better" in terms of developing better habits. Interviewee B pointed out that the audience is "most likely in the 10-39 age range because that’s the age group that is more likely to be sleep-deprived and are at risk of poor health." All seem to agree that the storyline flows nicely and that the texts support their respective content. 

There were some confusion and thoughts on the speedometer. Some commented that it is hard to read and that it is difficult to see the seriousness of it. A mentioned that the differences in the distance don't do much since there is no scale. B agreed that including a scale would be nice to have. C also noted that speedometers and treemaps are not your typical visualizations, and that "if someone has never seen these visualizations before, they might make assumptions and get inaccurate information." 

I tried to get each interviewee to brainstorm as many adjustments to the current visualizations as they can by bouncing ideas back and forth. Below are some of the recommendations they suggested:

Vis 1
- A, B, and C commented that it was straightforward.

Vis 2
- B and C commented that it was straightforward.
- A commented that there might be a better type of chart to demonstrate this information. She showed me an earnings chart which shows the actual and estimate of each respective year. Instead of a bar chart, this is just a dot to record each point in time. 
- A and B commented that using the green and red to indicate good and bad was a good design decision.

Vis 3
- As previously mentioned, many of them thought that it was difficult to understand the graph, specifically what the unit of the arrows indicates. 
- A and B commented that including a unit or scale would help improve understanding.
- B commented that it might be better to use green and red for the arrows instead of black and red to maintain consistency with the former graphs.
- C commented that "the third one gave me so much trouble. It looks like a clock, but I'm not sure what it is"

Vis 4
- A, B, and C thought that using the body with anatomy labels was creative.
- B suggested that the organization can be improved by using angled lines to structure where the texts go. 

Vis 5
- A, B, and C did not like the treemap. 
- A said that "as a person studying computer science, seeing this graph makes me think that it adds up to 100%." It also took them time before she understood what the graph meant. Hence, she suggested that using a bar chart might be simpler to explain the information.
- B said that they usually do not interact with treemaps a lot. While it does make sense to represent the data like so, they also believe that a pie chart could have done the same, in which the audience could see the proportions better. Another note they had was there was little to no description. For instance, it shows "mood", but "what does that mean?" So the audience has to think about it themselves that "mood is impacting them negatively."

Vis 6
- A, B, and C all appreciate the clock visualization and thought that the concept is intriguing. 

Vis 7
- A, B, and C all like the concept of the word cloud. However, A considered an alternative of using a bubble graph since "bubble graph shows consideration of all these options, whereas the words seem to imply one thing."

For the last two questions, everyone seemed to be on the same page. They all thought that the call to action exists, specifically that people should sleep more (but not too much) and be more mindful of their sleeping habits since there are lasting consequences. Additionally, there is no further information they require to complete the story.

## Final thoughts and upcoming changes

Based on the critiques, I am pretty confident about visualizations 1, 4, and 7.

For visualization 2, I will take the advice that A provided and use a chart similar to that. I will still keep the colors to help attract more attention to the age groups who are sleep-deprived. 

For visualization 3, I will add scales to the graph. I will try out the idea that B suggested, which is to use a green arrow for the group with more than 7 hours of sleep. After trying it out, I will determine if the colors seem to clash and decide from that.

I am currently undecided about how I will present the information for visualization 5. However, I am certain that I will not be using a treemap. My current backup is to use a bar chart similar to the one provided in the high-fidelity wireframe section. 

Based on the comments, 6 is also a solid visualization. However, I am thinking of changing it to be more of a continuous line as supposed to discrete pie slices. Hence, I will continue using the clock idea and have a line to represent deficient sleep, sufficient sleep, and excessive sleep around the clock to provide the continuous range. 

Another comment I thought that was helpful is being careful of the transition from talking about physical health to mental health, as well as the transition from risks of diseases to excessive sleeping. One thing that A recommended is that I add a slide specifically to present the transition so that customers do not feel that there is a huge jump between topics.
