# Final Project Part 1

## Outline

High-level summary: People are underestimating the impact of getting a good night sleep and are harming their physical and mental health in doing so.

1. The average American adult reports about two nights of insufficient sleep per week (many age groups are sleep-deprived).
2. Sleep deprivation increases the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke.
3. Sleep deprivation can also hinder you from thinking clearly and increase the odds of mental distress.
4. A vicious cycle of mental distress and sleepless nights exists. 
5. But what about excessive sleeping? That's also not healthy.
6. (So how do I) Sleep just right! 

## Initial Sketches

Here are some sketches of what I am planning to do. Notice that there is a number next to each graph - this number corresponds to which section the graph belongs to. These sketches are subject to change depending on the information found and flow of story.

## Data

I have a couple of data sets that I hope to explore. 

My first data source is located [here](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html). It is a dataset regarding short sleep duration by different categories such as gender and age, as well as risks associated with short sleep duration. This dataset will be used to show how many percentage of each group are not sleeping enough. 

My second data source is located [here](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/oj2638h42i/Results%20for%20YouGov%20Omnibus%20(Sleep)%20054%207.3.2019.xlsx%20%20[Group].pdf). It is a dataset containing self-reported sleep duration by different groups of people. This data set breaks down the information on age, income, gender, region, et cetera. For the purpose of this project, I will mostly explore age and gender. I will calculate the averages of each group and compare it against the recommended hours of sleep. This data source also reports qualitative information regarding sleep, so I might dive into that as well. 

My third data source is located [here](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-facts-statistics). The primary purpose of this source is to highlight certain information and create emphasized visualizations to make a statement. Unlike the previous two sources, this source is primarily an aggregation of different stastical sources and reported into one to create an article on sleep statistics. I know that I will definitely be able to learn more about sleeping patterns to help shape my narrative better. 

My fourth data source is located [here](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SIA-2020-Q1-Report.pdf). This article contains information on how sleep deprivation affects daily activities. This is related to how sleep deprivation affects mental health and can be used to support how sleep deprivation leads to an unproductive lifestyle. Additionally, this [page](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/professionals/sleep-america-polls) contains polls from previous years that I can learn about. There is also information on the comparison of sleep schedules for weekdays versus weekends, statistics of how many percent of people felt well-rested, and more!

My fifth data source is located [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163498/). Similar to the previous source, it also discusses the effects of sleep deprivation on mental health. The main difference between these two is that this source talks about how different age groups is affected by sleep deprivation. I will use these two sources to discuss how sleep deprivation can hinder one's mind. 

My sixth data source is located [here](https://amerisleep.com/blog/oversleeping-the-health-effects/). Unlike the previous sources, this one requires me to parse through the information myself to gather the statistics that I need. After skimming the article, I am positive that this source will help me provide evidence of effects of oversleeping. It will also be helpful in terms of providing recommendations and statistics for the "Sleep just right" section. 


## Method and Medium

For the wireframe and storyboard component, I will be using Figma. Because I am already used to Figma's interface, I thought it would be the most convenient way to test out my high-fidelity prototypes. That way, it will allow me to save time using something that I am comfortable with and will also allow me to produce results that are reflective of my sketched prototypes faster. 

For the data visualization component, I will be using Tableau. The primary reasons for using Tableau are its flexibility and my passion to explore Tableau more. Without a doubt, Tableau is one of the most versatile visualization tools, and considering the types of data that I will be using, I am confident that Tableau will be able to support my needs. Additionally, I hope to develop more skills in Tableau, meaning that practicing and creating visualizations in Tableau will help me achieve my goal. Another software that I am considering using is RAWGraphs.   

For the presentation component, I will be using Shorthand after I have generated the charts and refined my story.
