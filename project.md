[Data Story](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/sleep/index.html)

### Intended Audience

With sleep applying to people of all ages, gender, and nationality, my audience includes everybody. Initially, my data story was aimed to target people who are in college. As a college student myself, I am aware of the unhealthy decisions that we make and would like to inform other students to develop healthy habits instead. By promoting good hygiene, people will be able to mitigate certain risks that come with sleep deprivation.

However, after learning more on the topic, I decided to focus on people who are aged 18 - 29 because this group of people is the one that has the least amount of sleep among adults and is the most prone to different disorders as a result of their actions. I also realized that sleep deprivation is more common than I thought. Hence, rather than just focusing on a small group, I could reach a broader audience in which in this case there is a one size fits all solution. Throughout the final story, I specifically highlighted this group as well as 30 - 49 to show that they are way below average.

### Design Decisions 



### Progress and Learning Points



### Updated Data Sources

My first data source is located [here](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html). This dataset will be used to show how the risks of not getting sufficient sleep.

My second data source is located [here](https://news.gallup.com/poll/166553/less-recommended-amount-sleep.aspx). It is a dataset on how long each age group sleeps. It also compares sleep across different time periods.

My third data source is located [here](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-facts-statistics). The primary purpose of this source is to highlight certain information and create emphasized visualizations to make a statement. Unlike the previous two sources, this source is primarily an aggregation of different stastical sources and reported into one to create an article on sleep statistics. I know that I will definitely be able to learn more about sleeping patterns to help shape my narrative better. 

My fourth data source is located [here](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SIA-2020-Q1-Report.pdf). This article contains information on how sleep deprivation affects daily activities. This is related to how sleep deprivation affects mental health and can be used to support how sleep deprivation leads to an unproductive lifestyle. Additionally, this [page](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/professionals/sleep-america-polls) contains polls from previous years that I can learn about. There is also information on the comparison of sleep schedules for weekdays versus weekends, statistics of how many percent of people felt well-rested, and more!
